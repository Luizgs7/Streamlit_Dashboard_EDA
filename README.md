# Streamlit Dashboard

This repository was created during my studies about the python package [Stremlit](https://streamlit.io/), that builds web apps in python that can be used to build interactive dashboards and are easily deployed in the [Streamlit Share](https://share.streamlit.io/) plattaform.

My app is deployed in this [link](https://share.streamlit.io/luizgs7/streamlit_dashboard_eda/main/streamlit.py). There it is possible to import a file and easily make a simple exploratory data analysis of your data.
